      <h1>Getting Started</h1>
      <p>Thank you for installing Pholio! Pholio is the easiest way to create custom photo galleries on your iPad. You can easily add photos from either your Flickr account or from your iPad photo library. You can drag-and-drop to get your presentation exactly the way you want it.</p>
      <h6>3 Tips for Getting the Most out of Pholio</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Long Press.</strong> This is the most important trick for using Pholio. When you do a long press on a gallery, a picture, or even empty space, Pholio shows the menu of things you can do to the item you tapped. This is how you add new pictures, delete pictures and galleries, and access the cut / copy / paste commands.</p>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Drag and Drop.</strong> Rearranging photos and galleries is quick and intuitive with drag-and-drop. Just move the picture or gallery to wherever you want it to go.</p>
          
          <p><em>Tip:</em> If you have trouble moving a gallery or photo, start by moving the picture horizontally. If you start by moving it vertically, Pholio thinks you are trying to scroll the entire collection.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Renaming.</strong> You rename things by tapping the name in the title bar. This works for photos and for galleries.</p>
          
          <p><em>Tip:</em> You can even change the title on the Pholio main screen from <em>Pholio</em> to whatever you want&#8230; like the name of your photography business!</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Most importantly, <strong>have fun with your pictures!</strong> Use your iPad to show your best work to your friends, your family, and your clients.</p>
