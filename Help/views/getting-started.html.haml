  Thank you for installing Pholio! Pholio is the easiest way to create custom
  photo galleries on your iPad. You can easily add photos from either your Flickr
  account or from your iPad photo library. You can drag-and-drop to get your
  presentation exactly the way you want it.
  
%h6 3 Tips for Getting the Most out of Pholio

       **Long Press.** This is the most important trick for using Pholio. 
       When you do a long press on a gallery, a picture, or even empty space,
       Pholio shows the menu of things you can do to the item you tapped. This is
       how you add new pictures, delete pictures and galleries, and access the
       cut / copy / paste commands.

      **Drag and Drop.** Rearranging photos and galleries is quick and intuitive
      with drag-and-drop. Just move the picture or gallery to wherever you want
      it to go.

      *Tip:* If you have trouble moving a gallery or photo, start by moving
      the picture horizontally. If you start by moving it vertically, Pholio
      thinks you are trying to scroll the entire collection.

       **Renaming.** You rename things by tapping the name in the title bar. 
       This works for photos and for galleries.
     
       *Tip:* You can even change the title on the Pholio main screen from *Pholio*
       to whatever you want... like the name of your photography business!

  your best work to your friends, your family, and your clients.
